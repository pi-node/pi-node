# Logging

The service logs messages to the console and to a file named device-management.log. The log level can be configured using the LOG_LEVEL environment variable or the logging.level configuration option.

Server
The service runs on a Node.js server and listens on port 3001. The server can be configured using the SERVER_HOST and SERVER_PORT environment variables or the server.host and server.port configuration options.

Create an `api/index.js` file to define the API entry point:

```
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Import API routes
const devices = require('./routes/devices');

// Register API routes
router.use('/devices', devices);

module.exports = router;
```

Create a routes/ directory for API routes and a controllers/ directory for API controllers.

Create a models/ directory for data models and a services/ directory for external service calls.
