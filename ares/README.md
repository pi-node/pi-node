# ARES for Pi-Supernode

**Autonomous Resilience and Enhancement System (ARES)** is an advanced AI-based feature designed to enhance the operations of **pi-supernode**, a lightweight node for the Pi Network ecosystem. ARES autonomously overcomes technical challenges, fixes code deficiencies, maintains the price stability of Pi Coin at $314,159, and ensures the security and scalability of the network.

## Objectives

ARES aims to:
- Automate the repair of code and missing or incomplete features.
- Maintain the value of Pi Coin as a stablecoin with a fixed price of $314,159 across the entire ecosystem (exchanges, partners, users).
- Optimize resources on Raspberry Pi devices for maximum efficiency.
- Protect the network from threats such as DDoS, market manipulation, or blockchain attacks.
- Facilitate integration with exchanges, financial partners, and other blockchains.
- Support scalability for mass adoption of Pi Network.

## Main Features

1. **Code Analyzer & Generator**:
   - Detects missing code files (e.g., `consensus.js`, `wallet.js`) or bugs.
   - Automatically generates or fixes code with appropriate templates.

2. **Price Stabilizer**:
   - Monitors the price of Pi Coin in real-time and adjusts supply (burn/mint) to maintain the value of $314,159.
   - Ready to be integrated with oracles (e.g., Chainlink) for accurate price data.

3. **Resource Manager**:
   - Optimizes the use of CPU, RAM, and storage on Raspberry Pi.
   - Prevents overload to maintain node stability.

4. **Threat Detector**:
   - Monitors threats such as DDoS, suspicious transactions, or consensus attacks.
   - Applies real-time mitigation actions.

5. **Integration Engine**:
   - Provides API to connect pi-supernode with exchanges, financial partners, and other blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).

6. **Network Orchestrator**:
   - Distributes load between supernodes for scalability.
   - Manages the addition of new nodes dynamically.

## Prerequisites

- **Device**: Raspberry Pi 3/4 (recommended) or a server with Node.js.
- **Operating System**: Linux (Raspbian, Ubuntu, etc.) or compatible.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Node.js v16 or newer.
  - npm for package management.
- **Network Connection**: Stable internet for synchronization and external integrations.

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-supernode.git
   cd pi-supernode
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ARES requires additional libraries: package.json

   ```json  
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "express": "^4.18.2",
       "node-fetch": "^2.6.7",
       "@tensorflow/tfjs-node": "^4.0.0",
       "ws": "^8.12.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   Install them:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run Supernode with ARES**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   ARES will automatically initialize, scan the code, and optimize operations.

## Usage

After running, ARES will:
- **Scan Code**: Check for missing files (e.g., core/blockchain.js) and generate required files.
- **Stabilize Price**: Monitor Pi Coin price and adjust supply if necessary.
- **Optimize Resources**: Ensure the node runs efficiently on Raspberry Pi.
- **Protect Network**: Detect and mitigate threats in real-time.
- **Manage Integrations**: Prepare connections with exchanges and partners (additional configuration required).
- **Orchestrate Network**: Distribute load for scalability.

### Example Log Output:
```
Initializing ARES for pi-supernode...
Found 2 issues in codebase: [{ type: 'missing_file', file: 'core/wallet.js' }, ...]
Generated core/wallet.js
Price stable at $314159
Resource usage: CPU=0.3, Mem=0.7
Monitoring for network threats...
Pi-Supernode running on port 3000
```

## Advanced Configuration

Edit `ares/price_stabilizer.js` to integrate a real oracle:
```javascript
async fetchPrice() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=pi-network&vs_currencies=usd');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data['pi-network']?.usd || this.targetPrice;
}
```

Add API keys for exchanges or oracles in the `.env` file.

## Testing

ARES comes with basic tests to ensure functionality. 

1. **Install Mocha**:
   ```bash
   npm install mocha --save-dev
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx mocha test/ares_tests.js
   ```

### Example Test:
```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const ARES = require('../ares/ares_core');

describe('ARES', () => {
  it('should initialize without errors', async () => {
    const ares = new ARES();
    await ares.initialize();
    assert.ok(true);
  });
});
```

## Notes

ARES is currently in early development. Some features (e.g., real oracle integration, advanced threat detection) require additional configuration. For optimal performance on Raspberry Pi, monitor resource usage and adjust parameters in `resource_manager.js`. Join the Pi Network community to discuss ARES's potential in supporting the stablecoin ecosystem.

Thank you for using ARES to strengthen pi-supernode! Together, we can make Pi Coin a global stablecoin with a value of $314,159.
